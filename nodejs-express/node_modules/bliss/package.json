Framework template engines.\n\nI became hooked on using Play! framework's Scala templates, which was inspired by Razor templates. I liked it so much, that I found I really wanted to use something similar on Node.js. \n\n\n## Details\n\nSee [wiki](https://github.com/cstivers78/bliss/wiki) for details on use and syntax.\n\nSee [issues](https://github.com/cstivers78/bliss/issues) for details on bugs and features.\n",
